# 📚 Andrew's Knowledge Database

> Personal knowledge base for technical topics, development methodologies, and best practices.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This is my personal knowledge vault, organized in Obsidian, where I collect, structure, and systematize knowledge about:

- **Software Development** — programming languages, frameworks, tools
- **DevOps & Infrastructure** — Docker, CI/CD, monitoring, deployment
- **Methodologies** — Agile, Scrum, SDLC, project management
- **Architecture & Design** — patterns, best practices, system design
- **AI & ML** — RAG systems, vector databases, LLM integration

## 📁 Structure

```
📦 Obsidian Vault
 ┣ 📂 knowledge-database/     # Main knowledge base
 ┣ 📄 claude.md               # AI assistant guidelines
 ┗ 📄 README.md               # This file
```

## 🛠 Tools

- **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** — primary editor
- **Git** — version control and backup
- **Claude AI** — assistant for creating and structuring notes

## 📝 Note Format

Each note follows a unified standard:

### Frontmatter
```yaml
---
tags: [category, subcategory, specific-topic]
aliases: [Alternative names]
created: YYYY-MM-DD
topic: Broader Category
---
```

### Structure
1. **TL;DR** — brief summary in a callout block
2. **Fundamental Theory** — core concepts
3. **Practical Examples** — code snippets, use cases
4. **Visualization** — diagrams (Mermaid), tables
5. **Useful Links** — additional resources

Details: [`claude.md`](claude.md)

## 🔗 Navigation

Notes are interconnected through **wikilinks** (`[[Page Name]]`), which allows:
- Quick navigation between topics
- Viewing the knowledge graph in Obsidian
- Finding connections between concepts

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Me
1. Create notes through Claude or manually
2. Add practical examples from real projects
3. Link with other topics
4. Periodically update and expand

### For Others
If you found this repository:
- Can use it as a template for your vault
- Notes are written in Ukrainian with English terminology
- Focus on practicality and code examples

## 📌 Principles

- **Evergreen notes** — notes are living, constantly updated
- **Atomic notes** — one concept = one note
- **Progressive summarization** — from general to specific
- **Practicality > theory** — always examples from real-world use cases
